# Features:
* All of the terrain you see is randomly generated and infinite. There are also multiple types of worlds (big canyons, smaller hills, etc)
* Obstacles (wind columns and speed ballons) are randomly spawned as well.
* The glider follows realisitic aerodynamic rules. To calculate the aerodynamic coefficents, we used algorithms in the paper by Khan and Nahon 2015.
