# Features:
* All of the terrain you see is randomly generated and infinite. There are also multiple types of worlds (big canyons, smaller hills, etc)
* Obstacles (wind columns and speed ballons) are randomly spawned as well.
* The glider follows realisitic aerodynamic rules. To calculate the aerodynamic coefficents, we used algorithms in the paper by Khan and Nahon 2015.

# Things to know:
* When playing the game you can be glitched out, esc leaves the game, e brings up pause menu
* if you need help w/ controls there is help button on top left
* Very Very few computers may render the terrain as a pink purple, thats completely bugged, we don't know why it happens, don't play that version.
* Otherwise we hope you enjoy and have fun!
